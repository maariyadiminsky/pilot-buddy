## Setup

### Prod

https://superlative-lamington-b11177.netlify.app/

### Dev

#### Add Environment Variables

```
REACT_APP_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY='' // create your own key
REACT_APP_LOG_ROCKET_APP_ID='' // get this when you sign up for logrocket and go through their steps
REACT_APP_SPEECHLY_APP_ID='' // not required
REACT_APP_USE_SPEECHLY='false' // false if not using REACT_APP_SPEECHLY_APP_ID
```

#### Start Development Environment

- run `yarn install` then `yarn start`.
- run `yarn test`, or `yarn test:coverage` to see coverage, `yarn test -- [component/page/utils method name].spec.tsx` to run specific test.
- go to `https://localhost:3000/`. You might get a security warning, this is because I am using https while developing without a SSL certificate, feel free to go to Advanced -> Proceed if you're on Chrome.

## Future Improvements

- The current test coverage for the project is 42%. I am planning to enhance this by adding more tests for additional components, hooks, and methods. The goal is also to provide a more comprehensive and detailed test suite for the existing test files.

- At the moment, some components are overloaded with logic, which can complicate the structure. My objective is to improve this by decoupling the logic from the rendering aspect of these components. This will include migrating some logic to standalone utility/service files, while other logic will remain in dedicated logic components. The rendering will then be handled by its own streamlined component, leading to a cleaner and more manageable codebase.
